:floppy_disk: [Installer](https://github.com/emoacht/Wifinian/releases/download/3.1.0-Installer/WifinianInstaller310.zip)

## Install/Uninstall

If you wish to place executable files on your own, you can extract them from installer file (.msi) by the following command:

```
msiexec /a [source msi file path] targetdir=[destination folder path (absolute path)] /qn
```

In such case, please note the following:

 - The settings file will be created at: `[system drive]\Users\[user name]\AppData\Local\Wifinian\`
 - When you check [Start on sign in], a registry value will be added to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

## Remarks

 - To rename a wireless profile, press and hold its name.
 - Rescan of wireless networks by OS itself is triggered by some actions and if no such actions take place, seems to be performed once per one minute.
 - Automatic connection by Engage function applies only to wireless profiles whose automatic switch are enabled. If a profile whose automatic switch is not enabled has been already connected, automatic connection will not be executed.
 - When you connect to a wireless network by OS's wireless menu, the order of wireless profiles may be automatically changed.
 - A wireless profile is associated with a specific wireless adapter and if the adapter is not in place, such profile will not be shown.

### How to delete wireless profiles from OS's GUI

The GUI to delete wireless profiles has come back in Windows 8.1 Update. To reach this GUI, see the following.

#### Windows 10

[Network settings] from notification area (or [Settings] from Start menu) &rarr; [Network & Internet] &rarr; [Wi-Fi] &rarr; [Manage WiFi Settings] &rarr; [Manage known networks]

Note: If multiple profiles of the same name exist (it will happen if you connected to the same wireless network using multiple wireless adapters because SSID of wireless network is used for a profile name), such profiles will not be differentiated and will be deleted in bulk.

#### Windows 8.1 Update

[Settings] in Charm &rarr; [Change PC settings] &rarr; [Network] &rarr; [Connections] &rarr; [Manage known networks] in [Wi-Fi]
